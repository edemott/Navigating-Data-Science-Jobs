# Data Science Job Trends Analysis

This project involves the analysis of data science job trends over the last 5 years, using Python and advanced visualization techniques. It also includes building a Random Forest model to predict salaries based on various factors, and communicating the findings through a professional scientific research poster.


## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze trends in the data science job market over the past five years, focusing on factors such as job location, years of experience, education level, and salary. Using Python, various data analysis and machine learning techniques were applied to the data to identify patterns and trends. Additionally, a Random Forest model was built to predict salaries based on the identified factors.

A scientific research poster was created to present the findings in a clear and professional manner, summarizing the analysis and its implications for data science professionals and employers.

## Objectives

- Analyze the evolution of data science job trends over the past 5 years.
- Build a Random Forest model to predict salaries based on factors like job location, education, and experience.
- Create a professional research poster to effectively communicate findings and insights.
- Conduct independent research to draw conclusions and provide actionable recommendations for job seekers and employers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building the Random Forest model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Advanced visualization of job trends.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and presenting the code.
- **PowerPoint**: For creating the research poster.

## Data Sources

The project uses publicly available data from multiple job boards, including:
- **Kaggle**: Datasets containing data science job listings, salaries, and job descriptions.

### Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used Pandas and Seaborn to perform a detailed analysis of trends like salary distribution, job locations, education levels, and required skills.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to show key insights from the data.

### Predictive Modeling

- **Random Forest Model**: Used Scikit-learn to build a Random Forest model that predicts salaries based on features such as experience, education, job location, and job type.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

## Results

- Identified key factors influencing data science salaries, including job location, education level, and years of experience.
- Found that data science salaries have increased over the past five years, with a significant demand for professionals in AI and machine learning fields.

## Poster

A professional scientific research poster was created to present the findings of the analysis. The poster summarizes the key insights, methodologies, and results, and serves as a clear visual communication tool for presenting the work in academic or professional settings.
